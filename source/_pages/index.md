The cost of housing in Santa Cruz is outrageous. For renters, securing safe, stable housing is a difficult task. Most jobs in Santa Cruz don't pay enough for a renting employee to afford even a one-bedroom apartmment. So we scour the listings on [Craigslist](https://craigslist.com) for "affordable" options. Every once in a while, it seems like we [find one](https://sfbay.craigslist.org/scz/apa/d/santa-cruz-studio-for-rent/7002541470.html). As I have recently learned, finding an "affordable" place to live, will sometimes cost you more than you're willing to pay.

I moved in to [339 Goss Avenue](https://www.google.com/maps/place/339+Goss+Ave,+Santa+Cruz,+CA+95065/@36.9895425,-122.0075448,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x808e4011c63bad57:0x9cc9438de5a55a3f!8m2!3d36.9895425!4d-122.0053561) in March of 2019. It's a lovely place! I had been living in a shared-housing situation and I was looking for my "own place." I came across Joe Trent's place on Craigslist and it appeared to fit my needs nicely. The rent was $1,350 per month, which was more than I had been paying but still considered a "good deal" by Santa Cruz standards. Five hundred square-feet, nice kitchen. Sweet!

The problem, as it turned out, was the landlord, Joe Trent. What an asshole.

"I want it to be kept clean in here," he said when I first looked at the place.

"Sure," I said. I'd just moved from a place with multiple housemates where I was known as "the clean one." An avid cook, I can make a mess like the best of them, but I always clean up after, as I like a clean facility the next time I cook. In any case, Joe was charging $2,700 for a cleaning deposit, so I didn't really see how it was any of his business. If I trashed the place, he could take any damages out of that.
